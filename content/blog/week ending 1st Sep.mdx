Week started with shifting the house on Monday. But even before that Saturday and Sunday passed by in making it happen. There is this strage thing that hapens when you shift to a new place or a new setting. You get dis
oriented. It took me a while to understand it. Its not easy to get into focus zone and do creative work in a new setting it takes a while. The week was struggle but also a tale of good persevarance. The implementation of Monte Carlo and understanding the research paper on Agent Q were major accomplishments. Apart from of course setting up the house. The house is lit af.

The best part of the week was releasing our first python package on Pypi. The vision was realized for the first tieme. build browser agents in just three lines of code!

Another good thing that happened was that I hosted Suyash or any firend after a lonf time. Pretty proud of that. Life moves too fast and sometimes firends get lfet behind. This would not happen anymore. Remember there three only three things in life which I need to take care while having fun - health, relationship and work. I am glad I did something to make relationship happen.

Reliazed that I typically had low trust. I think I get from dad. But realization is the first step. The owner is not signing the contact and I am bit worried but I have chosed to trust. Hopefully she is busy and will sign it soon.

Also met a founder who had recently moved on from startup. Had lot of empathy for him. Shared my jouney with him. I am sure he will do great in life, just like me!
